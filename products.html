                But what makes our honey so special?
                Yemeni Sidr Honey is one of the finest honeys in the world. Its elite reputation is built
                through
                the distinctive features of the sacred Sidr trees (Ziziphus spina Christi, L. Willd.). The Sidr
                tree
                has a unique, aromatic smell that easily attracts the bees that look forward to the rich feast
                served in the flower caps of these trees. The nectar produced inside the flowers is extremely
                potent
                and full of nutritional values which contribute to the medicinal qualities of the honey. The
                Sidr
                trees grow uncultivated in the desolated areas of Yemen, untouched by chemicals, drugs nor
                modern
                machinery. The honey is produced with traditional beekeeping methods that include only simple
                tools
                but a lot of diligence and well-preserved craft passed on to generations.
